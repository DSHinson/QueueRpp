## Introduction

QueueRpp is built to facilitate the creation, management, and consumption of message queues. This project can be used as a base for developing more complex messaging systems and can be integrated into larger applications requiring reliable message processing.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DSHinson/QueueRpp.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd QueueRpp
    ```

3. Build the solution:
    - Open `QueueHub.sln` in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
    - Restore the necessary packages and build the solution.

## Usage
